          Experimental Techniques in the Contemporary Art of the USA and their
          impact on global trends
        </h2>
        <p class="main__text">
          The social and cultural changes of recent decades have led to dramatic
          shifts in artistic thinking and the social functioning of contemporary
          art. The creative achievements in American art of the mid-twentieth
          and early twenty-first centuries became the basis for the renewal of
          artistic paradigms in the direction of significant visualisation,
          synthesis of style and genre parameters, mass and democratisation in
          the representation of art objects. The aim of the study is to examine
          the evolution of experimental techniques and the ways they function in
          a globalised contemporary society. The limited scope of the study
          prompted us to turn to the most significant periods of the formation
          of the latest aesthetics and techniques within American pop art and
          their transformations in digital and post-digital technologies of the
          last decade. The transformation of the avant-garde's stylistic
          indicators in pop art has made the latter a semantic link that has
          connected the artistic achievements of the avant-garde with global
          changes in the culture of postmodernism and contemporary creativity.
          This position is the novelty of the study. The methodological
          foundations of the presented work are the fundamental principles of
          epistemology; the principles of historicism and systematicity; a
          contextual study of the works of leading masters and their comparative
          characteristics. The analysis of the available literature and art
          objects allowed us to identify the defining stylistic paradigms
          inherent in the art of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: focus
          on mass, stylistic and stylistic synthetics, visualisation through
          changes in the formation of artistic space, the use of digital and
          post-digital technical means, and the symbiosis of the national and
          the global.

        <h3 class="main__content-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="main__text">
          The American artistic and cultural environment of the 1950s and 1960s
          was a springboard where experimental techniques flourished. They
          determined the general trends in the development of art over the next
          decades and largely retain their priority position in the spread and
          implementation of modern technologies in the artistic practice of
          today. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, and they are rooted
          in the social, political, economic, and cultural life of the post-war
          world. The radical changes in the middle of the last century caused
          tectonic shifts in the culture of production and consumption, and,
          accordingly, formed a different attitude to things - material and
          cultural - from the pre-war times. Representational painting, as a
          sign of traditional art values and worldview, gave way to more
          relevant ways of artistic reflection, which determined the leading
          paths in art of the following decades. The "American era", which was
          established and dominated in the field of artistic creativity in the
          middle of the last century, was fuelled by the explosive energy of
          abstract artists, new thinking with a fundamental rejection of
          traditional values, and formed ideological and worldview guidelines
          relevant to the new social demands of the time. Experimental artistic
          techniques and stylistic trends of the mid-twentieth century, enriched
          with innovative technologies and stylistic branches in accordance with
          local national traditions, retain their significance in contemporary
          art. In this sense, the purpose of the proposed study is to analyse
          American artistic techniques in terms of their evolution from direct
          intersections with the European avant-garde of the early twentieth
          century to entering the mainstream of postmodern realities established
          in the following decades, which retain a global international
          character in the XXI century
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Of particular significance in the characteristics of contemporary
          manifestations of postmodernism is the definition of the parameters of
          the influences brought by the American artistic environment on
          established national cultures and the ways in which they are
          synthesised with local traditions. Significant improvements and
          expansion of the technical possibilities of designing art objects with
          digital and post-digital technologies make it possible to understand
          the artistic creativity of the first decades of the twenty-first
          century as the latest stage in the development of experimental
          artistic techniques. The study of the transformations of the creative
          attitudes of the middle of the last century into the art media of the
          present day and their role in the creation of a new virtual reality is
          the novelty of the proposed work.

          Literature review
        </h3>
        <p class="main__text">
          The literature on this topic constitutes a significant body of work,
          mostly of English origin, that explores various aspects of the history
          and functioning of American experimental techniques. Among them,
          several substantive thematic groups can be identified.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          One such group includes works addressing the history of the emergence
          and formation of pop art in the context of general cultural, artistic,
          and social circumstances of the mid-twentieth century. Notably, the
          works of the direct initiators and participants of these processes are
          particularly informative. Fundamental contributions in this field are
          made by Alloway (1974), Lippard (2024), and Finch (1968), whose
          publications provide detailed and comprehensive information about the
          artists' practices, historical background, and contextual frameworks.
          Sinclair (2023) offers a retrospective collection of memoirs and
          documents that illuminate the activities of prominent American Pop Art
          figures.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          A separate thematic cluster encompasses publications focusing on
          various aspects of Robert Rauschenberg’s work, a pivotal figure in the
          Pop Art movement. Choay and Elliot (2021) analyse the influence of
          Dadaist aesthetics and their transformation into neo-Dadaism, which
          largely merges avant-garde practices with postmodern experience.
          Selvin (2021) evaluates the synthesis of genres in Rauschenberg’s
          scenographic work and his collaboration with Cunningham, particularly
          regarding the impact of Pop Art achievements on subsequent artistic
          developments. Trepess (2022) provides an original perspective on the
          elements of Rauschenberg’s 1960s combines.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Further studies explore the interactions and mutual influences between
          Pop Art and Eastern artistic traditions (Munroe, 2009; Clarke, 1988;
          Robert, 2022). Additionally, significant retrospective editions—such
          as Robert Rauschenberg: A Retrospective (1997), Robert Rauschenberg:
          Solo and Two-Person Exhibitions (2023), and Robert Rauschenberg
          Foundation. Chronology (2021)—offer annotated catalogues and
          reproduction albums that serve as rich visual sources for evaluating
          and analysing Pop Art works.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Finally, a foundational source in this field is the work of Miles
          (2023), which functions as a guide to avant-garde art movements from
          the mid-twentieth century to the present. In the author’s terminology,
          the book is situated within the framework of “political aesthetics,”
          enabling a nuanced interpretation of the transformations in artistic
          systems as responses to historical and social dynamics. A number of
          works with analytical materials, announcements, and exhibition reviews
          are dedicated to leading contemporary American artists. These texts
          convey mostly original critical impressions and can serve as a
          “starting point” for the study and evaluation of artistic material
          from the perspective adopted in this research (Wiley, 2024;
          Richardson, 2024; IFPDA Graphics Fair; Prince, 2025).
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          A significant corpus of publications covers various aspects of the use
          of digital technologies in the creation of contemporary visual art.
          These include reviews, announcements, exhibitions, and video projects
          by leading American artists in this field (Kim, n.d.; Ryder, 2023).
          Several works are dedicated to the historical development of digital
          art technologies (Paul, 2021; Aras, 2023; Harding, 2019; IFPDA
          Graphics Fair; Galerie Natalie Obadie, 2025), allowing for
          comprehensive analysis of the scope and impact of both digital and
          post-digital technologies in shaping new visual worlds of the 21st
          century.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Recent years have also seen increased attention to the ethical
          dimensions of creating secondary art objects and to the problem of
          preserving originality and aesthetic value in contemporary art. These
          issues are explored in the works of Sharareh (2023) and Wiratno
          (2024).
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Referring to diverse aspects in the selection of sources allows for
          the formation of a holistic understanding of the stated problems.

            creativity of the twentieth and twenty-first</em

        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          The formation of one of the most powerful trends in the spectrum of
          experimental techniques is associated with the emergence of pop art in
          the middle of the last century. Formally, the beginning of American
          pop art is considered to be the New Realists exhibition by Sidney
          Janis in October 1962, which featured works by Jim Dine, Roy
          Lichtenstein, Robert Indiana, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Andy
          Warhol and Tom Wesselmann. This circle of artists formed the centre
          and preserved the significance of their work as iconic representatives
          of Pop Art, with Robert Rauschenberg at the centre.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Robert Rauschenberg has been compared to the universal artists of the
          Renaissance. His creative heritage has an unprecedented richness of
          projects, exhibition presentations, review and scientific materials
          dedicated to his work. The factual volume of retrospective
          publications with a chronology of works, exhibitions and documentary
          materials can give an idea of the scale of the artist's activity. Over
          the course of about 60 years of active work, the artist changed
          several periods, avoiding radical changes in style, worked in the
          fields of scenography, photography, design, and tested various
          semantic and stylistic components (collage, assemblage, performance,
          hapening techniques, development of scenography, theatrical costumes,
          installations, including synthetic ones with the use of organic
          materials, sound and light, etc.) In 1984, Rauschenberg founded the
          Foundation in his name, which provided support to artists, organised
          travelling exhibitions with constantly changing expositions, etc. His
          success at the Venice Biennale (1964) cemented his reputation as one
          of the most influential artists of the second half of the twentieth
          century.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          The compositions of 1950-1960 were based on numerous variants of
          juxtapositions of heterogeneous textured surfaces with the inclusion
          of three-dimensional fragments. One of Rauschenberg's most significant
          achievements was the further development of collage, assemblage and
          installation techniques, which had entered the active artistic space
          with the spread of the avant-garde in the 1910s. The development of
          these techniques in pop art gained an active impetus after the success
          of the exhibition "The Art of Assemblage", which took place at the New
          York Museum of Modern Art in 1961. Rauschenberg developed collage from
          a reception to an aesthetic. In fact, all his projects included
          techniques of juxtaposing different material environments. This
          manifested the artist's tendency to experimental, sometimes openly
          provocative thinking, which gave impetus to the discovery of new
          multimedia ways of visual reflection of artistic ideas. The
          interactive ideas of the combines found their fuller embodiment in the
          grandiose projects "Oracle" with the involvement of a sound
          installation and in the light and sound composition "Soundings"
          (1968). In these works, Rauschenberg combined visuality with
          multimedia technologies and organic materials. The idea of the
          convergence of living organics and the sounds of music expanded the
          awareness of beauty and the possibilities of embodying the traditional
          classical idea of the inseparable unity of natura naturans with natura
          naturata and paved the way for a new visuality of the following
          decades. These works, in fact, marked the beginning of the development
          and flourishing of interactivity as one of the most relevant trends in
          twenty-first century art. Thus, the rejection of the avant-garde
          aesthetics in the context of post-war American artistic culture in pop
          art as one of the most productive artistic trends activated the
          following qualities that became integral indicators of the following
          stages of contemporary art, namely, its mass and democratic nature,
          levelling the boundaries between the elite and the profane, synthetic
          and hybridisation of genres, styles, artistic and local, postmodern
          game manipulativeness, and the transfer of responsibility for creating
          meaning to the recipient of culture.

          <em>Influences of American Pop Art on World Artistic Creativity</em>
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          The influence of Pop Art on European and Asian art had different forms
          and ways of objectification. Parallel and simultaneous trends with
          American Pop Art developed in German art. Konrad Lueg, Sigmar Polke,
          Gerhard Richter (Düsseldorf) reproduced in various ways the samples of
          "industrial" advertising, assimilated by American Pop Art (pictorial
          transformations of cropped advertisements, reflections of different
          stages of commercial colour printing, performances in shops, etc. The
          samples were based on the materials of the American print edition of
          Art International from 1963. The work of the Swedish artist Oyvind
          Fahlström, who was directly connected with the circle of artists
          working in New York, was also marked by copying and varying the ideas
          of already widespread examples of pop art. He was interested in the
          new possibilities of performance based on the language of comics (the
          "variable paintings"). The Belgian artist Evelyn Axell continued the
          ideas of American pop art in the technique of collage montage of
          cut-out female silhouettes. The Icelandic artist Erro lived and worked
          in Paris, met Rauschenberg and Lichtenstein, from whom he adopted the
          collage technique, in his version burdened with socio-political
          motives.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Pop art was also influenced by Soviet art. Like artists in Poland,
          Hungary, and East Germany, they applied the ideas and techniques of
          Pop Art with signs of veiled parody or political satire, depending on
          the conditions in which they had to work. In the Soviet Union, an
          extraordinary social art emerged, a kind of transcription of social
          realism (Vitalii Komar and Oleksandr Melamid), the essence of which
          was the use of pop art techniques for a subtle hidden critique of
          Soviet realities.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          American Pop Art also had a "targeted" influence on artists. In the
          most obvious form, it was reflected in the work of Damien Steven
          Hirst, the most famous and one of the most provocative contemporary
          artists, a member of the Young British Artists group. His main field
          of activity is working with installations. In this sense, Hirst's
          technique continues and imitates the methods laid down in this field
          by American Pop Art. For example, as in the work of Marcel Duchamp,
          Hirst's compositions are red-measures loaded with a certain social
          semantics. It can be assessed as a continuation of the tendencies laid
          down in Rauschenberg's early collages, the involvement of shocking and
          sometimes scandalous elements in the form of animal simulacra
          (Rauschenberg's stuffed birds) in the installations. An example is a
          group of works with the theme of aquariums, which he himself refers to
          as the "Natural History" series with a conceptual basis. According to
          the artist, the deliberately hyperbolic, shocking and frank acuteness
          of the subjects is intended to attract the viewers' attention and
          provide impulses for reflection on the themes of life and death, the
          need to preserve nature, etc. A certain continuity with American Pop
          Art can be seen in Hirst's interest in the theme of the purpose of art
          and its relationship with reality. The artist explains the shocking
          nature of some of his works as his attempt to be truthful in his work.
          The "archaeology of modernity" inherited from Rauschenberg turns into
          a detailed frankness in an attempt to reflect the dramatic aspects of
          modernity in his work
        </p>

        <p class="main__text">
          The contemporary British artist Tracey Emin, who is more lyrical in
          her compositions, is also a member of the Young British Artists group
          and follows Hirst's style. Like Hirst, Emin is quite provocative and
          outspoken. Following the traditions of American pop art, the artist
          adheres to multidimensional themes and works in virtually all genres
          of art. As in Hirst's works, the conceptual approach to the choice of
          themes and subjects is burdened by the extremely complex and pointed
          subject matter filling the artistic space. The success of the English
          masters serves as proof of the vitality of the values proclaimed in
          American art more than seventy years ago and the preservation of
          social demand for the value of its achievements.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Japan developed its own version of American Pop Art. Rauschenberg
          visited Japan and collaborated with a Japanese company involved in the
          production of ceramics. As a result, techniques derived from
          silk-screen printing became active in Rauschenberg's work, and a
          centre of pop artists led by Ushio Shinohara emerged in Japan. His
          series "Imitation Art", which featured Rauschenberg's own version of
          Coca-Cola, appeared rather as a sign of respect for the guest. In his
          subsequent works, he turned to more obvious national traditions: the
          collages were based on prints of traditional ukiyo prints as elements.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          In Brazil, the trends laid down by American Pop Art were embodied
          under the names "The New Figure", "Popcreteau", "New Brazilian
          Objectivity" (the names of exhibitions of the 1960s). In the context
          of active resistance and confrontation with the American support for
          the anti-popular regime, artistic movements associated with national
          and realistic trends were strong. Nevertheless, in this country, as a
          result of general global trends towards industrialisation and
          modernisation, centres of new art emerged, such as The Instituto
          Torcuato Di Tella (ITCT), partially funded by the Ford and Rockefeller
          Foundations, which became the centre of Argentine pop art. Mass art
          found its successful realisation mainly in the field of collages of
          advertising settings and happenings, with the authorship of Minujín
          and Santantonín. Thus, the development of the latest artistic
          techniques within pop art on the scale of its global influences
          acquired the significance of a general style trend, as it had the
          potential to synthesise local (national) and global trends.

          The works of Kehinde Wiley , one of the most famous and successful
          contemporary artists in the United States, are distinguished by a
          unique interpretation of the traditions of painting in his best
          examples of English portrait art of the fifteenth and first century in
          the style of Reynolds and Gainsborough. Detailed texture painting,
          exquisite colour palette, realism in the portrayal of models - all
          these features of the classical portrait of the Baroque and Classicism
          are present in numerous works of the master. The choice of a
          decorative background can also be considered traditional - the
          landscapes in Gainsborough's portraits do not look realistic, they
          reflect the state of mind of their characters.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          As in classic portraiture, all of Kehinde Wiley's works feature black
          men and women dressed in modern or traditional clothing, posed in
          relaxed but expressive poses in the centre of the canvas. The models
          are beautiful, in the prime of life. In the same way, the artist
          portrayed President Barack Obama as an outstanding son of his people.
          But the canvases evoke a strange sense of dissonance - the portrait
          images do not correlate with the background filling, which is dense
          decorative, sometimes ornamental, and has no connection with academic
          traditions. The collage effect is emphasised by the clear contours in
          the images of the models. There is a semantic multilayeredness of
          stylistic, genre, and historical origin. The traditional stylistics of
          the paintings is read as a resistance to traditions or stylisations of
          traditions. The influence of pop art guidelines is reflected as a
          distant hint of the richness of collage techniques. To this must be
          added another component in the spectrum of expressiveness: the works
          are part of the series Archaeology of Silence, which was presented in
          2024 in Houston as a monumental panorama of contemporary black
          American heroes. The title is commented by the author: "What I love
          about art is that it takes known combinations and transforms them in a
          way that sheds light on something they've never seen before or allows
          them to see the world in a different way." (Kehinde Wiley, 2024). In
          the author's statement, the postmodern conceptuality of the works,
          their social and civic orientation is evident. It is reinforced by the
          repetition of subjects throughout the series and the repetition of the
          constructive and stylistic solution in the relationship between
          portrait and background. The "Austinato" in adherence to a single
          compositional solution throughout the portrait panorama switches the
          perception from purely portrait characteristics to the "ornamental"
          component of the idea. The emphasis on the use of these techniques
          highlights the social and civic components as dominant in this
          project. As the artist himself puts it, his work with detailed
          depictions of black characters is intended to counter the silence
          surrounding injustice and violence (ibid.).

        <p class="main__text">
          The work of another black New York artist, Mikalyn Thomas, is equally
          popular and successful. Her works are exhibited in all major
          contemporary art museums in the United States, Canada, Tokyo, and
          Greece; numerous exhibitions, in which she prefers collective
          expositions, have received attention from the press and curators.
          Mikalin works in various fields - design, photography, collages in
          various formsincluding mixed media photo collages, involving painting,
          etc. Participation in the Dior Lady Art project encouraged her to use
          fragments of her work in the form of applications (auto-citation), 3D
          printing, figurative embroidery with sequins and stone and rhinestone
          embellishments, etc. The models of her works are mostly beautiful
          black women surrounded by exquisite interiors. Thomas's latest series
          of mixed media photo collages was inspired by her research into images
          of black female eroticism presented in the calendars of Jet magazine
          and the pages of the 1950s French publication Nus Exotique
          (Richardson, 2024). The reference to the stylistic means of pop art of
          the mid-19th century is indicative of her original method: the artist
          uses sequins, crystals, and stones to decorate her works mainly along
          the contour, although she fills some details with the glitter of
          rhinestones. Figurative pictorial elements are combined with
          abstractions, collages, and engravings, often in ways that are unusual
          for these techniques. One of the latest series of photo collages is
          printed on metal, collage details are cut out with scissors and
          superimposed on each other, complementing the multi-layered texture
          with their own drawings and shiny finishes, creating a textured
          volume. The result is a three-dimensional structure that is a revived
          memory of the three-dimensional pop art compositions of the
          mid-twentieth century. As in the works of Kehinde Wiley, in the works
          of Mikalyn Thomas, the traditions of experimental techniques of the
          last century find not only new embodiments through their development
          and enrichment with artistic means and the latest materials, but also
          serve to express their civic position. The conceptuality of their
          artistic ideas is reinforced by the conceptuality of their views on
          the structure of society.

          The exhibition "Pop Forever, Tom Wesselmann &...", which took place at
          the turn of 2024-2025 at the initiative of the Louis Vuitton
          Foundation, was indicative of the continuation of American pop art
          trends in contemporary US art. The exhibition featured 70 works by
          artists of different generations and nationalities. The idea behind
          the exhibition is not only to promote the work of Tom Wesselmann and
          contemporary artists who to some extent imitate his achievements, but
          also to provide "visual" evidence of the relevance of pop art as one
          of the most influential trends in the art of the twentieth and early
          twenty-first centuries. The presented works allow us to understand
          both the creativity of the middle of the last century and the ways in
          which contemporary art is shaped by the influence of pop art, which is
          reflected in the title of the exhibition - "Pop Forever". Wesselmann's
          works organically synthesised multimedia elements - light, sound,
          video, movement. His neo-Dadaist prototypes initiated experiments in
          the field of collage. In this sense, the works by Micalyn Thomas
          presented at the exhibition are the best confirmation of the vitality
          and power of the creative achievements of the middle of the last
          century. The exhibition's massive scope also confirms the vitality of
          pop art's influence: in addition to works by pop art masters Tom
          Wesselman, Marcel Duchamp, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy
          Warhol, Richard Hamilton, etc, it presents works by artists of
          different nationalities and citizenships (USA, Nigeria, South Korea,
          Japan) whose work is connected with the United States (Micalyn Thomas,
          Marjorie Strider, Do Ho Soo, Njideki Akunyili Crosby, Evelyn Axell,
          Thomas Byrne, Jasper Johns, KAWS, etc.) The range of techniques in
          which they work has been expanded by modern multimedia and digital
          means. Thus, the exhibition reflects not only a retrospective, but
          also the prospect of further development of the trends and directions
          established in the middle of the last century and serves as a
          convincing proof of their relevance.

          <i> Digital technologies in modern media art techniques</i>

        <p class="main__text">
          The current stage in the development of the global trend towards the
          synthesis of arts, fully manifested in the work of pop art artists, in
          the field of artistic creativity is characterised by the widespread
          use and spread of digital technologies. Their use as tools has
          revealed a fundamental shift in the aesthetics and paradigms of the
          visual arts, in the awareness of the social and public functions of
          artistic creativity as such. The integration of visual, sound, and
          interactive elements transforms the perception of an art object into a
          new experience endowed with significant adaptability to socio-cultural
          changes in modern society. The effectiveness of digital technologies
          on the mass audience corresponds to the globalisation of the world and
          the dominance of industrial production. In fact, the mass nature of
          consumption inherent in pop art as a factor in its emergence and
          spread has been preserved and has gained a decisive influence in
          contemporary culture.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Among the areas in which modern digital technologies are actively
          used, collage and installation dominate as phenomena of the same order
          with different dynamics of functioning. The platform for their
          development and dissemination is the artistic environment, mainly in
          New York and Los Angeles. The "new materiality" of contemporary
          interactive art is embodied in

          The first of these manifestations is the work of one of the most
          successful contemporary media artists Refik Anadol, co-founder of
          Refik Anadol Studio, Dataland and RAS LAB. His studies in fine arts in
          Istanbul and in the Media Arts Design programme at the University of
          California gave him the opportunity to synthesise his knowledge of art
          and experience of creating IT products as an attempt to "draw data".
          The result is fantastic installations and videos that are impressive
          in scale and decorate the Venice Architecture Biennale (created
          together with the artist of Turkish-American origin Gökhan S.
          Hotamışlıgil), the three-part Unsupervised - Machine Hallucinations is
          part of the MoMA's permanent collection, the installation decorates
          the outer surface of the Las Vegas Sphere, etc. "Machine
          Hallucinations was created in collaboration with NASA JPL as a result
          of the AI network's reinterpretation of data obtained by the Hubble
          telescope. "Glacial Dream" (2023) was created as a result of
          processing an incredible amount of visual data with photographs of
          glaciers, some of which were collected by Anadolu, whose grandiose
          virtual image disintegrates into pixels as an allegory of the concept
          of the need to preserve nature. The work was the first experience
          within the NEXT programme, which aims to develop defining
          interdisciplinary trends in art, science and technology. New ways of
          artistic production in the visual arts are at the forefront of
          technological development and next-generation achievements. Anadolu's
          expertise in machine learning allows him to apply his own algorithms
          "as tools to create sketches or buildings as canvases - these have
          always been fundamental ideas in my imagination, inspired by science
          fiction" (Ryder, 2023) and design AI to learn and progress within the
          parameters set by the author. "Teaching our own AI models from scratch
          has allowed us to push the boundaries... AI algorithms designed to
          predict and mimic reality are trying to create 'real' things" (ibid.).
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          A similar technological approach using the capabilities of artificial
          intelligence is inherent in the work of the extremely successful
          artist Krista Kim: in collaboration with the biotechnology company
          Tenbeo, she created the installation Heart Space (2024), in which the
          reading of numerous electrocardiograms using AI provided a spectacular
          visual artistically reinterpreted picture of the human heart. Like
          Anadol, Kim has her own software technology with variable gradients.
          Her material for extrapolations is glass and plexiglass, with colour
          and light as the main tools. The artist's installations "Martian
          House" is a virtual environment recognised as "the first home in the
          Meta Universe" (KK, website), "Continuum" had a long-term exhibition
          in Times Square, collaboration with Louis Vuitton, the World Economic
          Forum in creating large-scale light and colour broadcasts on
          architectural elements, etc. testify to the productivity of the latest
          technologies and their public recognition.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Kim founded the Techism movement, which aims to promote the ideas of
          digital humanism and the integration of art and technology, without
          rejecting the existence of traditional modes of artistic expression.
          "Digital humanism" is interpreted by the artist as a means to
          strengthen ties between people, to create art that serves progress and
          interaction. The artist, as a master of technology, contributes to the
          creation of digital civilisation, but retains the priority of artistic
          thinking as a reflection of humanity. "Art will save us from
          ourselves" can be perceived as a motive for opposing the total
          digitalisation of modern life (ibid.).
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Another strategy of innovation, aimed at discovering new aspects in
          established trends, is represented in the work of Richard Prince, one
          of the most famous American artists of recent decades. His works
          reflect the trends of mass culture, but they can be seen as a
          paraphrase of the themes relevant to pop art. The hidden irony,
          perhaps a mockery of the unchanging human nature, gives the works
          their contemporary relevance. Prince's projects combine
          re-photographed images, advertising materials, and tabloid reading to
          create collage paintings and sculptures on themes inherent in American
          culture - cowboys, bikers, stars (Cowboys, Jokes and Hoods series),
          etc. The direct influence of pop art is complicated by the
          hypertrophied secondary nature of its products. This should initiate
          the question of the nature of originality and its aesthetic value in
          the contemporary art world, which reveals its relevance in the context
          of artistic multiplications of "ready-made" art products. The
          conceptuality of Pierce's projects constitutes an active semantic
          layer of the works and brings them into the discussion field.

        <p class="main__text">
          The American artistic environment of the mid-twentieth century was a
          space in which new art forms were born and established cultural
          traditions were transformed. In the context of mass production, a
          dialogue between different cultural forms became relevant. Artistic
          culture acquired multimodal qualities, which led to visual pluralism
          and variability in experimental manifestations.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          The concept of experimentalism has no conceptual status. Its use has
          become widespread because it reflects multiple and sometimes unstable
          facts of going beyond the boundaries of established phenomena or ideas
          and does not form certain trends or directions. Such innovative
          outbursts may not be developed and remain isolated manifestations of
          creative research. American experimental techniques within pop art
          have a different nature: numerous "experiments" with materials and
          ways of combining them and with the possibilities of new aesthetic
          patterns in post-war art culture were revolutionary, as they opened
          new paths in the art of the following decades and turned out to be
          elements of a larger phenomenon - postmodernism.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          First of all, it should be noted that American Pop Art was created by
          sources of European origin. Many European artists became emigrants
          during the war and post-war periods, and it was the American artists
          who were responsible for fanning the sparks of new art into a global
          phenomenon. Lawrence Alloway, an artist, ideologue, and art critic of
          British origin, was the first to introduce American art to the
          European public. He was a member of the British Independent Group, in
          the bowels of which the priorities of mass art and the very concept of
          "pop art" were formulated, in the early 1960s he combined the sprouts
          of the latest artistic trends into a powerful stylistic phenomenon of
          pop art and first used the term "pop art" publicly. Alloway saw in
          painting the extraordinary possibilities of visual communication in
          the face of dramatic social changes. The first definition of Pop Art
          was provided by Hamilton, also a member of this small group that
          existed in London at the turn of the 1950s and 1960s. Apart from the
          short-term and transitory significance of the new art, in which he was
          wrong, all the other characteristics of pop art he provided were
          absolutely accurate. The collage printed on the wrapper of a lollipop
          called "What Makes Today's House So Special, So Attractive?" (1956)
          used the word "pop", which became the defining word for the whole era.
          Marcel Duchamp, a French artist, the founder of Dadaism and
          Surrealism, which emerged in 1913, gave the new direction the
          necessary avant-garde creative intentions on the basis of American
          painting of the 1950s and 1960s. In pop art, the redi-made found by
          Duchamp within Dadaism, unlike the more traditional collage, acquired
          the meaning of an art object that was "ready" not only for artistic
          but also for social functioning. He also invented installations (the
          futuristic "Big Glass" of 1918-1920). In other words, the main and
          most indicative manifestations of the subsequent Pop Art were
          transposed into the American artistic context directly by the inventor
          of these trends, since Duchamp spent the most productive years of his
          life in the United States.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          At the height of the Cold War, when the United States was acquiring
          new spheres of influence, the achievements of American artists fully
          reflected the worldwide success of consumer ideology. In this context,
          the emergence of regional artistic circles in Europe, Japan, and Latin
          America, focused on the values of pop art, was a natural consequence
          of the formation of a global artistic and information space. Pop art
          was not only an artistic movement, but also a successful embodiment of
          the success of a new way of life and active communication. The direct
          connection between pop art and the industrial context was directly
          translated into artistic techniques. Corporate logos, billboards,
          utilitarian household items, etc. demonstrated the interdependence
          between popular culture and the techniques of its production and
          distribution. The techniques of transferring photos and press
          clippings, the use of airbrushes, screen printing, screen texts, and
          commercial marketing techniques (in the works of Andy Warhol and Roy
          Lichtenstein, for example) expanded media platforms and were the
          property not only of Pop Art as an art movement, but also of the
          established mass culture. The expanded media platforms of pop art
          intersected with other movements of the time, such as Fluxus, Nouveau
          Réalisme, Happenings, and formed a global world of artistic culture.
          The success of American pop art, most evident in Rauschenberg's
          creative biography, allowed European art to "return" a new quality of
          avant-garde (in the broad sense of the term) artistic paths in the
          following decades.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          The starting point in Rauschenberg's creative biography was abstract
          expressionism, "action painting", as critics called it. This direction
          was a logical continuation of the achievements of the avant-garde and
          retained its significance in the spectrum of stylistic manifestations
          in artistic practice over the next decades. For the artist, this short
          stage should be assessed as a period of searching for his own style
          and maturation of new aesthetic and ideological guidelines. The
          influence of Rauschenberg's initial fascination with the explosive
          expression of abstractionism with its immediacy of self-expression was
          continued in the equally large-scale projects of the first original
          period of his work, which saw a revolutionary break with the
          aesthetics and values of the avant-garde and the dominant
          establishment of pop art as a new style not only for the American art
          school, but also for European and, later, Asian contemporary art. This
          period (1953 - 1964) was caused by the invention of the so-called
          "combine" technique, i.e. a technique based on combinations of various
          painting techniques. A radical change in value priorities in relation
          to the previous avant-garde became the key to the formation of the
          style and in its main features determined the general trends in the
          artist's further biography.

        <p class="main__text">
          "Combines" were hybrid works that combined painting, collage and real
          objects of everyday life. The essence of the method was not only in
          the unexpected and random use of various materials, things and
          textures in the pictorial plane, often of everyday, even utilitarian
          origin, and their synthesis into a coherent composition. The
          aesthetics of heterogeneity prevailed in the expressive system of the
          combines. The equivalence of all the elements involved in the
          composition formed a strategy of perception of space and time that was
          different from figurative painting, based on the variability of ways
          and order of its "reading". The multiplicity of elements of the
          composition, not connected by the logic and history of relations,
          required consideration in an order not established by a certain
          "plot", which was to be determined by the viewer and provided the
          expected variability of perception. However, the main meaning of the
          stylistic revolution in Rauschenberg's harvesters was manifested in
          the artist's refusal to introduce his own personal sense of the world,
          the semantic centre of avant-garde aesthetics, into the art object.
          The seemingly illogical arrangement (although the surviving sketches
          and photographs of various compositional solutions indicate a certain
          conceptuality of the idea) caused the effect of the artist's
          detachment from the presented artefact, the traditional
          representational paradigm of painting yielded to the laws of new ideas
          about the purpose and essence of art. Rauschenberg believed that
          painting is located between art and life. "Neither of them can be
          done. I try to act in the gap between them" ("both art and life.
          Neither can be made. I try to act in the gap between the two" ( Robert
          Rauschenberg, 2023 ). The objects, which were not connected to each
          other by a narrative logic, provided the viewers with the opportunity
          to build their own worldview concepts of their interactions. The
          heightened sense of colour, line, composition as unique manifestations
          of the artist's artistic worlds, which reflected the imitation of
          avant-garde values, gave way to seemingly random combinations of
          images of various objects and materials, mostly well-known, endowed
          with recognisable symbolism, the meaning of the collision of which had
          to be unravelled by the viewer. Manipulating the codes and their
          meanings, in addition to the detachment of both the creator and the
          viewer, a certain "coolness" of perception, brought elements of a
          playful nature to the artefact. The artist's works were in the
          dynamics of dialogues with the viewer and the real world. Reality
          could be objectively "manifested" in the geometric juxtapositions of
          fabric pieces - the motive of using fabric elements was preserved
          throughout his work. Rauschenberg acknowledged his first mature
          drawing (The Mowed Lawn, 1954) as a pencil drawing of a body on a
          found fabric, his first combine, Untitled circa, 1953, had fabric
          inclusions, costumes for Merce Cunningham's choreography were an
          integral part of the set design, etc. A group of works consisted of
          fragments of fabrics superimposed on a grid ("Against the Grid:
          Drawings", 1983). The use of a grid ("network" - a lined and almost
          invisible base that set a certain geometric rhythm) was a common
          technique that Rauschenberg kept in his works of the 1980s and 1990s.
          The images superimposed on it could be inverted, mirrored, which
          correlates with musical polyphonic techniques and to some extent
          compensates for the lack of traditional methods of creating illusions
          of space in representational painting. The applied elements sometimes
          went beyond the limits of the given geometry, resulting in the effect
          of incommensurability of meter and rhythm, a kind of "syncopation" as
          a factor of compositional drama. Another variant of the use of fabric
          texture in the same years was the inclusion of draped fabrics of
          different formats (sizes, tension methods, etc.), which made it
          possible to convey textural multiplicity as different signs of reality
          with unspecified semantics and history.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          The "fabric theme" was further reflected in his later works. The
          silk-screen technique, first used by Rauschenberg in the early 1960s,
          becomes an active factor in the style. In Luxer and Twister (1991),
          silk stencils are covered with splashes of acrylic and matte ground,
          making the surface of the canvas multilayered and ambiguous. The
          effect of multilingualism and the depth of the reflected space is
          enhanced by the background of mirrored aluminium with deformation
          elements, in which the viewer could be reflected. The paintings use
          typical for Rauschenberg's style household items, utilitarian
          structures - roofs, fences, walls, views from windows, a wide range of
          materials - fabrics, photographs, watercolours, pencil drawings on
          paper, etc. Rauschenberg first turned to the "transfer technique",
          which used abstract and selected images transferred to silkscreen , in
          the early 1960s. However, they were fully used in the Spreads series
          (1975-1983). In the works of the Salvage series (1983-1985), the last
          series in which the canvas remained the basis, silk-screen printing is
          combined with photographs, either his own or transferred from the
          press (the transfer technique was established in Rauschenberg's style
          in the early 1950s), making them multi-component in their
          organisation. Although the borrowed images have a media origin, the
          depth of the semantic load is enhanced by the introduction of a verbal
          component: Rauschenberg uses a play on words, as salvage comes from
          the nautical lexicon and means collecting salvaged items after a
          shipwreck. Thus, the artist refers to the history of the images
          included in the composition. An additional semantic factor is the play
          on the words salvage and selvage, which means the remains of tissue
          after cutting. Perhaps this was a hint of the work on the costumes for
          the choreographic performance that preceded the series. The story of
          the "rescued scraps" found its place in the canvas, which intertwined
          the avant-garde experience of working with collages, postmodern play
          with meanings, personal memory of the early 1960s, impressions of
          choreographic plasticity and its pictorial design, etc. If the real
          world is an infinite picture for the artist, then he has the right to
          deconstruct it into the necessary elements and further recompose it
          into an artistic reality. Thus, the elements of aesthetics and
          philosophy of postmodernism were an integral part of the experimental
          techniques of the middle of the last century.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          The play with reflections of reality in its most obvious form was
          manifested in the provocative White Paintings. These works, as the
          critic put it, "completely changed our understanding of painting in
          the post-war period" (Robert Rauschenberg, 2021) and became milestones
          in the maturation of the Pop Art aesthetic. The beginning was the
          famous "Erased De Kooning Drawing" (1951), the first of this series.
          In his later works, the artist did not even touch the prepared white
          background, which completely gave the viewer the advantage of filling
          the artistic space with his own meaning.

          Collage and three-dimensional art objects, the introduction of verbal
          and sound components, conceptuality, elements of deconstruction and
          compositional reformatting in the works of Rauschenberg and his
          contemporaries have been further developed in the works of the
          twenty-first century. In the historical panorama of artistic
          creativity of the middle of the last century, the creative
          achievements and experience of American artists became a necessary
          transitional stage and at the same time a starting platform in the
          stylistic break between avant-garde and postmodernism.

        <p class="main__text">
          Experimental American artistic techniques play a crucial role in the
          functioning of contemporary art. The starting point in their formation
          was pop art as an artistic reflection of global changes in post-war
          society. Mass production led to mass consumption with dramatic changes
          in the creation and perception of artistic values;
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          American experimental techniques of the last century served as an
          intermediary link in the global stylistic evolution as a transitional
          stage between the avant-garde and postmodernism and its further forms;
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Pop art formed a new worldview on the nature of artistic creativity
          based on the artist's detachment from the art object, transferring the
          functions of co-author and interpreter of the semantic paradigms of
          the presented work to the recipient of culture. In this aspect,
          American pop art proved to be a direct predecessor of postmodernism,
          the formation of which coincided with the functioning of its
          aesthetics and techniques in the American environment;
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          American Pop Art was transnational in nature, driven by global shifts
          in all spheres of activity. Its influence on local manifestations in
          different national locations was manifested in various ways: direct
          copying with the introduction of national cultural elements,
          quotations and their interpretations, further development of artistic
          techniques and means by incorporating the latest technical and
          technological inventions;
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Pop art developed and produced the latest artistic techniques based on
          a diverse embodiment of the global trend towards the visualisation of
          an art object; it prompted changes in the understanding of artistic
          space and time, awareness of the role of the latest material elements,
          technical and constructive means and the multiplicity of their
          combinations;
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          The logical continuation of the development of the general cultural
          and artistic guidelines of American pop art was the active use of
          modern digital technologies as the most effective means of influencing
          the mass consciousness;
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          The use of VR, AR, and projection technologies is a modern
          interpretation of the artistic methods of forming a new artistic
          reality laid down by American experimental techniques. Social, public
          and ideological, applied (the newest culture of exhibition display),
          design (in the form of virtual additions to architectural compositions
          or material objects of fashion and everyday life) ways of embodying
          the ideology and aesthetics of American pop art, aimed at the mass
          consciousness, are democratic in nature and shape the worldview of
          modern society.
